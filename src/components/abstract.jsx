Chat-bot is a computer program which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Chat-bots are also used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chat-bots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simply scan for keywords within the input and pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a textual database. The chatbot is also known as chatter robots, are software agents that simulate human conversation via text or voice messages. One of the 1st and main goals of Chatbot had always been to resemble an intelligent human and make it hard for others to understand their real nature.",
